<div class="workshop">

<p class="title"><b class="author">Designing for Touchscreens and Interactive Gestures</b></p>
<p class="speakers">Bill DeRouchey, Dan Saffer</p>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
  Even though touchscreen and gestural technologies have been
  around for decades, they are only now being widely adopted for
  public use. The launches of Nintendo's Wii, Apple's iPhone, and
  Microsoft Surface have heralded a new era of interaction design
  where gestures in space and touches on a screen will be as
  prominent as pointing and clicking.
</p><p>
  But how do you create products and design experiences for this
  new paradigm? While most of us know how to design desktop and
  web applications, many are still wondering how to adequately
  design for interactive gestures.
</p><p class="stem">
  In this workshop you will:
</p><ul>
<li>Learn the key differences in designing for touch/gesture
</li><li>Learn how to design touch targets

</li><li>Explore the basics of ergonomics and kinesiology
</li><li>Create a paper prototype of a touchscreen/gestural interface
</li><li>Communicate presence and instruction
</li><li>Learn strategies for documenting a touch application
</li></ul><p>
  Learn the basics of designing for touchscreens and gestural
  interfaces in this hands-on workshop. <span class="speaker">Bill DeRouchey</span>,
  Interaction Design Director at Ziba Design and <span class="speaker">Dan Saffer</span>,
  Principal at Kicker Studio and author of the 2008 O'Reilly book
  <span class="booktitle">Designing Gestural Interfaces</span>, will lead this workshop.
</p><p>
  This workshop is for designers of all levels who want to expand
  their knowledge of interaction design into the new territory of
  interactive gestures. Through activities and mini-lectures on
  relevant topics, Dan and Bill will guide you in understanding
  the benefits and limitations of this new medium.

<div class="abstract">
<p>
Wireframes wacky? Flows <em class="nonEnglishWord">farkakt</em>?
</p><p>
These and other interaction design documents can be difficult to create and use in the best of circumstances,
 not to mention the tight time frames and politicized organizations in which we work.
 Web sites and interactive products are becoming more complex 
 and so, too, must the design documentation that describes them.
</p><p>

If you've spent any time pondering the ins and outs of any of these documents (or feel like you need to),
 this workshop is for you. Spend four hours with Dan Brown,
author of <span class="booktitle">Communicating Design</span>--the only book
 on user experience design documentation--as he leads you
  through an exploration of wireframes and flows.
</p><p>
During the course of the workshop, you'll hone your skills with these two key documents, essential tools for communicating interaction design concepts. By the end of the workshop, you will have worked through these two deliverables and gathered best practices that you can extend to all your documentation.
</p><p class="stem">
Participating in this hands-on workshop, you will:
</p><ul>
<li>Discuss success criteria for wireframes and flows
</li><li>Explore how different circumstances affect the content and format
</li><li>Define a process for creating documents, large and small
</li><li>Critique examples from Dan's portfolio and other sources
</li><li>Create different versions of these documents
</li><li>Practice presenting your documents

<p class="speakers">Jeannine Harriman, Liya Zheng</p>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
Interaction Design is a young field that spans many industries. 
Many of us learned the tools of the trade on the job. 
Because of this, there is a rich untapped number of approaches out there yet to be shared.
</p><p> 

This workshop is intended to bring together conference participants 
who are interested in seeing how others practice the craft. 
At the end of the workshop, you will understand how 
different design approaches yield different solutions 
and be more conscious about how to think about a problem differently from what you do now. 
</p><p>
This workshop will be highly collaborative.
It is designed to foster exchange of ideas between people of all different backgrounds working in the industry. 
We will start with a short presentation on how we have done our work in different circumstances. 
Then we break into teams to design an experience. 
The exercise is intended to push boundaries of what it means to do IxD. 
At the end of the exercise, you will be asked 
to visually communicate to the group your method of solving the problem. 
The goals of this presentation are to share how different practices 
yield different results and to have a facilitated discussion to discover themes in our practice.

<p class="speakers">Luke Wroblewski</p>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
In the world of Web applications, forms bridge the gap between 
people, their information, and your product or service. 
From registration forms that welcome new customers to checkout forms that finalize e-commerce transactions, 
Web forms frequently broker crucial online interactions.

</p>
<p>
In his full-day workshop, <span class="speaker">Luke Wroblewski</span>, author of the Rosenfeld Mediabook
<span class="booktitle">Web Form Design Best Practices</span>, 
will walk you through design considerations and best practices of form design 
culled from international site-tracking, usability testing, eye-tracking studies, and 
over eleven years of designing Web applications. 
He'll outline how the interaction and visual design of Web forms can make the difference 
between acquiring a customer and completing a transaction or not.
</p>
<p>
Through presentations, discussions, and hands-on exercises, 
attendees will learn how different types of forms, input fields, input labels, 
validation, feedback, calls to action, and surrounding visual elements 
can support or impair different aspects of user behavior. 
The workshop is structured to provide attendees with an understanding 
of the right "best" practices for their specific context, 
so they can quickly go from the quintessential design answer of "it depends" 
(on the business goals, user needs, and context of your forms) to actionable solutions. 
After this workshop, you'll never look at web forms the same way again.

<div class="abstract"><p>
This workshop is intended for interaction designers who have little to no
experience with hardware/software design and are interested in expanding
their practice into this rapidly-growing space.  Interaction design practice
changes as it moves off the desktop and beyond keyboard and mouse input.
Designers face new considerations of physical and environmental context, as
well as new opportunities and constraints based in the different
technological platforms, physical forms and use paradigms.</p><p>

In this practical, hands-on workshop, we'll share insights and principles
from our own experiences and those of some leading practitioners in the
field.  We'll provide guidance on working effectively with industrial
designers and electrical and mechanical engineers to create the best
possible user experience.  In addition, we'll discuss how a
hardware/software interaction design perspective will help you navigate the
new world of product ecosystems and service design.</p><p>

The session will include a design exercise where small teams will try their
hand at developing a hardware/software design. Come prepared to engage
deeply, to provide constructive feedback, and to take home new skills and a
new way of thinking about your work and future.</p><p>

<div class="abstract"><p>
This half-day seminar will provide a solid background in Interaction Design (IxD) for those who are coming to the practice of IxD from other areas, such as information architecture, software engineering, business analysis, project or product management, technical writing, architecture, industrial design, visual design, and interactive design.
</p><p>
 

The first part of the workshop will give participants a solid grasp of the history of IxD and the role it plays in the design of digital systems (mostly software). In reviewing the history of IxD, participants will gain an understanding of the foundational elements of interaction design and the language that connects them.</p><p>

 

The next part of the workshop will give students one of many frameworks that interaction designers use to guide them towards designing an interactive solution. This framework spans the project lifecycle: from research to ideation, to frameworking and refinement of designs, and then to validation and deliverable documentation.</p><p>

 

During the workshop, participants will perform hands-on exercises and engage in facilitated discussion. Throughout the session, resources will be provided to enable participants to continue to learn about the theory and practice of interaction design on their own, and to begin to incorporate its techniques and principles into their work.</p>

If you've ever seen <span class="speaker">Jared Spool</span> speak about usability, you know that he's probably the most effective, knowledgeable communicator on the subject today. What you probably don't know is that he has guided the research agenda and built User Interface Engineering into the largest research organization of its kind in the world. He's been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term "usability" was ever associated with computers.</p>
<p>Jared spends his time working with the research teams at the company, helps clients understand how to solve their design problems, explains to reporters and industry analysts what the current state of design is all about, and is a top-rated speaker at more than 20 conferences every year. He is also the conference chair and keynote speaker at the annual User Interface Conference, is on the faculty of the Tufts University Gordon Institute, and manages to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time.
