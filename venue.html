<p><b class="author">About Vancouver</b></p>
<p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
<p>Vancouver is a coastal city and major seaport located in the Lower Mainland of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It is the largest city in British Columbia and in the Pacific Northwest region. It is bounded by the Strait of Georgia, Burrard Inlet, the Fraser River, the Coast Mountains, and the city of Burnaby. Vancouver is named after Captain George Vancouver, a British explorer.</p>
<p>The population of the city of Vancouver is 611,869 and the population of Metro Vancouver is 2,249,725 (2007 estimate).  Vancouver is also part of the slightly larger Lower Mainland metropolitan area which comprises a total population of 2,524,113.  This makes it the largest metropolitan area in Western Canada and the third largest in the country. Vancouver is ethnically diverse, with 52% of city residents and 43% of Metro residents having a first language other than English.</p>
<p>Vancouver was first settled in the 1860s as a result of immigration caused by the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, particularly from the United States, although many immigrants did not remain after the rush. The city developed rapidly from a small lumber mill town into a metropolitan centre following the arrival of the transcontinental railway in 1887. The Port of Vancouver became internationally significant after the completion of the Panama Canal, which reduced freight rates in the 1920s and made it viable to ship export-bound prairie grain west through Vancouver. It has since become the busiest seaport in Canada, and exports more cargo than any other port in North America.

<p><b class="author">Getting to Vancouver</b></p>
<p>If you&#39;re arriving by air, you&#39;ll most likely be flying into Vancouver International Airport (YVR). Located just 25 minutes from downtown, YVR is consistently rated one of the best airports in North America. There are more than a dozen international flights in and out of YVR every day, with 22 bound for the United States.</p>
